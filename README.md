# Screenshot Viewer and OCR
Overview
A simple Android app that provides a seamless experience for viewing and managing screenshots. The app leverages modern Android development principles and integrates Google ML Kit for OCR and image labeling. It follows the MVVM architecture, uses Hilt for dependency injection, Room for local data storage, and employs Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous programming.

## Features
- Image Sync
  - Automatically syncs images from the device's screenshot gallery.
  - Utilizes Android's Content Provider to fetch and display images.
- Text Recognition with Google's ML Kit
  - Implements Google's ML Kit for on-device text recognition (OCR).
  - Populates the description field in the 'Screenshot Details' page with OCR data extracted from the selected image.
- Image Labeling
  - Uses Google's ML Kit for on-device image labeling.
  - Collections in the app are based on the labels generated from image labeling.
- User-Friendly UI
  - Horizontal image strip for easy navigation.
  - Full image preview on the 'Screenshot Details' page.
  - Intuitive design for a smooth user experience.
